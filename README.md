# dlreg

Django-based minimalistic LDAP user registration service.

A simple web form to add user. Asks for username, first & last name, etc and
adds the user to LDAP.

Supports also verification question, that must be answered correctly. This is
to avoid spambots registering junk accounts.

Contributions welcome!
